## March 23 2024
* removed extra quit button in system tray icon when minimized. system tray icon now always visible (previously icon only show when main window not visible.).
* added opacity options in snapshop context menu and hotkeys. 
* added opacity snapshot opacity change on mouse hover (to see stuff under the snapshot without moving it)
* when reopening images from recycling bin, the old image is raised to top of the list and will take the current time.
* image is now saved to recycle bin on open instead of on close. (so that if program crash or pc is turned off, the history is not lost.)
* added pin main window to top button. (this might be occasionally useful for tablet users without an keyboard?)
