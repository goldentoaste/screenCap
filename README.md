# screenCap

A Windows(only) program made in python with the intention to replicate a old Japanese program named 'SETUNA', which lacks an English translation and has minor graphics compatibilities issues with modern systems. This program allows you to take screenshots, crop a section of it, and pin it to be always on top, along with many other features for productivity gains.

Here is a [modernized](https://github.com/tylearymf/SETUNA2) version of SETUNA, but it is not in English.(And I rather write my own program instead of translating this one :P)
